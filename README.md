# Meet App
This is a React app that will allow users to find events in specified cities.

## How serverless functions will be used
The Meet App will use various serverless functions for things such as user authentication, processing data, and analyzing data. The app must be able to take information of events and display them in a readable way for the users to consume. This also includes not just a list of events, but also the user's profile. User information is still sensitive, so authentication will be needed. Serverless functions can also handle high traffic if many users are trying to interact with a certain event that is happening at the time.
